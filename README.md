## MacSHELL 1\.90


</div>

### Description

MacSHELL is a macintosh look alike shell for windows. My main idea was to emulate the macintosh system as accurately as possible. It still doesn't look completely like the mac but I hope to add more mac features soon!

I got lots of feedback from my first two versions and now I have updated it as best as I can. There is lots of room for improvement so please leave your comments.
